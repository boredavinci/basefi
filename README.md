## Decentralized Lending on Base

BaseFi is a decentralized lending platform built on the Base blockchain. This repository contains the codebase for the platform and instructions for setting it up locally.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have PNPM installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pnpm init
   ```

#### Running Locally

Start the local development server by running:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:port`, where `port` is the port number on which the server is running.
